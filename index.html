      <p>Welcome to Not Mastermind.</p>
      <p>
        The goal of this game is to guess the order of four random colors. 
        A color may be used more than once, but not every color is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        After each guess, 0 to 4 pips will appear to the left of your guess. An 
        unfilled pip denotes a correct color in the wrong spot. A filled pip denotes
        a correct color in the correct spot. HOWEVER, the location of the pip does 
        not correspond to a location of your guess.
      </p>
      <p><b>Controls:</b></p>
      <p>
        Clicking on a color will fill the leftmost empty cell with that color.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can click on a filled cell to clear it.
