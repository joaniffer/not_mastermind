      <p>Welcome to Not Mastermind.</p>
      <p>
        The goal of this game is to guess the order of four random colors. 
        A color may be used more than once. By the pigeonhole principle (sorry), 
        not every color is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        After each guess, 0 to 4 pips will appear to the left of your guess. An 
        unfilled pip denotes a correct color in the wrong spot. A filled pip denotes
        a correct color in the correct spot. HOWEVER, the location of the pip does 
        not correspond to a location of your guess.
      </p>
      <p><b>Controls:</b></p>
      <p><s>
        If a cell is selected (by clicking on an unfilled cell), clicking a color 
        peg will fill that cell.</s> Otherwise, the leftmost unfilled cell will be
        filled.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can click on a filled cell to clear it.
      </p>
      <p><s>
        You can type the character of the color peg instead of clicking a color peg, 
        and you can type &lt;enter&gt; instead of clicking the submit button.
      </s></p>
      <p>
        Refreshing the page will give you a new puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes I am aware the solution can be found in the developer console. This is 
        an open source, static web page, what did you expect?
